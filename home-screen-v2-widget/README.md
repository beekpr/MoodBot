# Home Screen Example Widget

A project showcasing home screen widget development by example.

**This is a work in progress and prompt to changes.**

## Get Started

First, let's install all dependencies by running:

```sh
yarn install
```

Now, we can start the development server:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Or, build the widget:

```sh
yarn build
```

To use your widget in a test tenant, you will need to expose your widget to testing device. If both devices are in the same network, this should be simple. You should see the address of the development server on the console. Otherwise, we recommend to use a solution like [NGROK](https://ngrok.com/), or building the widget and hosting it on a server of your choice.
